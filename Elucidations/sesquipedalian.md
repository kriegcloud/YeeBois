Horace, the ancient Roman poet known for his satire, was merely being gently ironic when he cautioned young poets against using _sesquipedalia verba_—"words a foot and a half long"—in his book _Ars poetica_, a collection of maxims about writing. But in the 17th century, English literary critics decided the word _sesquipedalian_ could be very useful for lambasting writers using unnecessarily long words. Robert Southey used it to make two jibes at once when he wrote "the verses of [16th-century English poet] Stephen Hawes are as full of barbarous sesquipedalian Latinisms, as the prose of [the 18th-century periodical] the _Rambler_." The Latin prefix _sesqui-_ is used in modern English to mean "one and a half times," as in _[sesquicentennial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sesquicentennial)_ (a 150th anniversary).
