Behold Trevor, in the formative years of his [[Elucidations/juvenescence|juvenescence]], already [[Elucidations/floriferous|floriferous]] in the art of [[Elucidations/confound|confounding]] his friends and foes. His knack for juking ideological entrapment was and still is, [[Elucidations/prodigious|prodigious]]. Picture, if you will, your average boomer [[Elucidations/pedagogue|pedagogue]] suddenly beset by this adolescent—a 15-year-old exemplar of nordic complexion, with blonde [[Elucidations/coiffure|coiffure]] and a [[Elucidations/cerulean|cerulean]]gaze. The lad [[Elucidations/yeeted|yeeted]] not just respectable academic [[Elucidations/laurels|laurels]] but also performed his duties befitting a mind [[Elucidations/ensconced|ensconced]] in layers of complexity—a mind not merely [[Elucidations/perspicacious|perspicacious]], but capable of orchestrating psychological pandemonium that ensnares focus and vexxes the mind.

**Defensive:**
- [[Elucidations/Obliviate|Obliviate]]
**Offensive:**
- Have the ability to completly [[ensconced|ensconce]] yourself in novel idealogies
- Mirroring
- Enter the mind of the enemy
- embody the archetype of the idealogy
- Argue from their point of view better than the oposition can
- Gain confidence.
- Allow the enemy to delegate their verbal defenses
- play on the enemies desire to forgoe confrontation
- Dependency is created
- the defenses are lowered
- engage your enemies enemy as they would
- the enemies enemy is your friend.
- the friend knows the higher order goal.
- Friend verbally assisinates
