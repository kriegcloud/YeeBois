By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need to [set up an authentication endpoint](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/authentication) to enable permissions.
