Behold the grandiose paradigm of TypeScript's existential quandary! Herein lies a majestic conundrum, a veritable symphony of types, akin to the philosophical musings of yore.

You are bestowed with two potential pursuits of paramount desire: 'Money' – a symbol of opulence and financial abundance, and 'Bitches' – a pursuit of carnality. Alas, the all mighty dictates a cruel twist; one must choose the path of either 'Lucre' or 'Damsels', yet cannot, under the laws of this existential chess game, tread both paths concurrently. This is not merely a choice, but a profound reflection of one's innermost values.

```
type EsotericEnigma = true extends boolean ? 'Money' : 'Bitches';
```

Should 'true' deign to reveal itself as a boolean, a veritable amount of `Money` is bestowed. Conversely, if 'true' is naught but a charlatan, then alas, a mere `Bitches` is your fate 'ChaliceOfChicanery'. A quarelsome bitchery of types and anti-types .

At the moment EsotericEnigma returns `Money`


If you were to reverse `true extends boolean` and create a variable assigned to false

```
type EsotericEnigma = boolean extends true ? 'Work' : 'Bitches';

const funk = (check: boolean) => {};

const moment: boolean = false

func(moment)
```

Typescript would through the following error.
```
TS2345: Argument of type false is not assignable to parameter of type true
```

Now lets extend our Enigma.
```

```
